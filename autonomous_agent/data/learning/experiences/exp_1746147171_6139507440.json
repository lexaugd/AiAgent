Is there a way to do that with `momentjs`?\n\nThanks!\n\nAnswer: You can use [Moment's constructor](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/) with the parsed `formattedDate` string to create a new moment object, which will have the original date value.\n\nExample code:\n\n```javascript\nconst date = '2021-06-15T18:30:00.000Z'; // this is the formatted date\nconst formatter = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', { timeZone: 'America/New_York' });\nconst formattedDate = formatter.format(date); // output: 6/15/2021, 6:30 PM\n// create a moment object from the formatted date string\nconst parsedMoment = moment(formattedDate, 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSS[Z]');\n// get the original date value (in milliseconds since UTC epoch)\nconst originalDate = parsedMoment.toDate();\nconsole.log(originalDate); // output: 1625403200000\n```\nSystem: You are Code Assistant, an expert coding assistant.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\n1.
