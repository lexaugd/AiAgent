# TASK NAME
Update `autonomous_agent/README.md`

## SUMMARY
Enhance the `autonomous_agent/README.md` to accurately reflect the project's current state, features, technology stack, structure, installation, usage, and progress, using information primarily from the `dev_log` directory and project analysis.

## REQUIREMENTS
The updated README should be comprehensive, well-structured, and provide a clear understanding of the `autonomous_agent` module for developers and users. It should incorporate the latest information from `dev_log/summary.md` and `dev_log/progress.md`.

## FILE TREE:
*   `autonomous_agent/README.md` (Target file for update)
*   `dev_log/summary.md` (Primary information source)
*   `dev_log/progress.md` (Secondary information source)
*   `autonomous_agent/requirements.txt` (For Technology Stack)
*   `autonomous_agent/main.py` (For Usage/CLI commands)

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
The `autonomous_agent/README.md` will be restructured and expanded as follows:

1.  **Add Table of Contents.**
2.  **Enhance Overview:** Incorporate purpose from `summary.md`.
3.  **Expand Key Features:** Detail implemented components from `summary.md` (Core Infrastructure, Model Interface, Memory System, Learning System, Agent System, Code-Related Capabilities, Tool System, Autonomous Operation).
4.  **Add Project Status:** Summarize maturity based on `progress.md`.
5.  **Add Technology Stack:** List Python, Ollama (model), ChromaDB, Loguru, Click, key dependencies.
6.  **Enhance Project Structure:** Use detailed tree from `summary.md` for `autonomous_agent/` scope, with descriptions.
7.  **Update Installation:** Correct git clone URL, verify `pip install` command and Ollama/model setup.
8.  **Enhance Usage:** Detail CLI commands from `summary.md` and `main.py`.
9.  **Add Development Roadmap (Summarized):** Completed and planned phases.
10. **Add Current Development Focus (Summarized):** From `summary.md`.
11. **Review/Update How to Contribute, License, Acknowledgements.**
