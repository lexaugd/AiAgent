  "prompt": "\nDesign a class called LRUCache that implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.\n\nImplement the following methods:\n1. __init__(self, capacity): Initialize the LRU cache with positive capacity.\n2. get(self, key): Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.\n3. put(self, key, value): Update the value of the key if it exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity, evict the least recently used key.\n\nBoth get and put operations should have O(1) time complexity.\n\nProvide a complete Python implementation with comments explaining your approach.\n",
  "response": "Here is an example of how you could implement this using Python's built-in collections library which provides us with the OrderedDict data structure that maintains its order. This data structure allows for efficient insertions, deletions and searches in O(1) time complexity. \n\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\nclass LRUCache:\n    def __init__(self, capacity):\n        \"\"\"Initialize the LRU cache with positive capacity.\"\"\"\n        self.cache = OrderedDict() # Use an ordered dictionary to keep track of order \n        self.capacity = capacity   # Set the maximum size of the cache\n\n    def get(self, key):\n        \"\"\"Return the value of the key if it exists, otherwise return -1.\"\"\"\n        try:\n            value = self.cache.pop(key)     # Try to remove and return the value of the given key from dictionary \n            self.cache[key] = value         # Add back the popped item with its new value in LRU order\n            return value                    # Return the value if it exists, otherwise KeyError will be raised\n        except KeyError:                    \n            return -1                       # If key does not exist in dictionary \n\n    def put(self, key, value):\n        \"\"\"Update the value of the key if it exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache.\"\"\"\n        try:\n            self.cache.pop(key)             # Try to remove and discard old value from dictionary\n        except KeyError:                    # If key does not exist in dictionary \n            if len(self.cache) == self.capacity:   # Check if we reached capacity limit\n                self.cache.popitem(last=False)     # Remove the oldest item (first added to dict) from cache\n        self.cache[key] = value             # Add new key-value pair in LRU order \n```\nIn this implementation, `OrderedDict` is used as a hashmap where keys are unique and values represent data stored in the cache. The advantage of using an ordered dictionary here is that it maintains its insertion order so we can easily remove the oldest item when capacity limit is reached. When getting or putting items, we first try to pop the desired key from the dictionary which gives us O(1) time complexity for both operations. If the key does not exist in our cache, a `KeyError` will be raised and we return -1 as required.\n",
