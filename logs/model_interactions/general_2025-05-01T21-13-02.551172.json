  "response": "The bugs in the provided Python code are as follows:\n\nIn function `factorial(n)`:\n1. The recursive call to calculate factorial is missing -1 at its end which means it will not reduce the size of 'n' and hence, it will result into infinite loop or stack overflow error if we provide a positive integer input for n. It should be `return n * factorial(n-1)`\n\nIn function `binary_search(arr, target)`:\n1. The right variable is not correctly set to the last index of array. It should be `right = len(arr) - 1` so that it points to the last element in the list for binary search.\n2. If the target value is not found and left exceeds right, then function will return -1 without checking remaining elements which might lead to wrong result or unnecessary computation if the array is sorted. It should have a condition to check whether the target exists within the given range of indices. \n\nHere's the corrected code:\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)   # Fixed: added -1 to recursive call\n        \ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    left = 0\n    right = len(arr) - 1   # Fixed: set right correctly\n    \n    while left <= right:      # Added condition to check if the target exists within range of indices.\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - <\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>10<-10-1   # Fixed: added -1 to move the search range towards left side.\n            \n    return -1   # Added condition to check if the element is not found in array.\n```\n",
