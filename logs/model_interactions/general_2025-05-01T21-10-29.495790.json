  "response": "The bugs in the code are as follows:\n\nIn function `factorial(n)`, there is a recursion without reducing the argument by one at every step which can lead to infinite recursion if not handled correctly. \n- Solution: The bug is fixed by adding '-1' to the end of the recursive call in the else block as follows: `return n * factorial(n - 1)`. This way, for each recursive call, we are reducing 'n' by one and hence will eventually reach a point where 'n' becomes less than or equal to zero causing it to return 1 which is the base case of our factorial function.\n\nIn function `binary_search(arr, target)`, there is an off-by-one error in setting up the right boundary for binary search as follows: `right = len(arr)` instead of `len(arr) - 1`. This will cause a 'IndexError' if the target element exists at index equal to length of array because Python uses zero-based indexing and it does not include the last item in the range.\n- Solution: The bug is fixed by setting up right boundary as `len(arr) - 1` which correctly represents the last index of our list.\n",
