# Autonomous Coding Agent Project Reboot

## What the project is
This project aims to build an autonomous coding agent using a locally-hosted large language model (LLM). Specifically, we're using the Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored model in GGUF format to create a system capable of:

1. Writing, reviewing, and refactoring code
2. Maintaining both short-term and long-term memory
3. Self-improvement through reflection
4. Multi-agent collaboration for peer improvement
5. Operating entirely locally without external API dependencies

The system is designed to be completely free to use, leveraging open-source tools and libraries to create a powerful autonomous coding assistant.

## Where we left off
We have completed the initial implementation of the core components of the system. This includes:
- Setting up the project structure and required dependencies
  - Created a well-organized directory structure
  - Defined Python package for easy installation
  - Listed all required dependencies in requirements.txt
- Implementing the model interface layer for communication with the LLM
  - Created an abstraction layer using OpenAI's API format with Ollama
  - Added support for both synchronous and asynchronous generations
  - Implemented streaming responses for better user experience
- Creating the short-term memory module using conversation buffers
  - Developed a Message class for standardized conversations
  - Implemented automatic token management to stay within context limits
  - Added conversation persistence with JSON serialization
- Developing the base agent class with core functionalities
  - Created process and response generation methods
  - Added reflection capabilities for self-improvement
  - Implemented state management for persistence
- Creating a specialized coding agent for code generation and manipulation
  - Added programming language detection
  - Implemented specialized code generation, explanation, and review capabilities
  - Created code block extraction and processing utilities
- Implementing an orchestrator to coordinate between different agent types
  - Added request routing based on content analysis
  - Created support for specialized agent collaboration
  - Implemented agent cloning functionality
- Setting up a CLI interface for user interaction
  - Added interactive chat mode
  - Implemented file processing capabilities
  - Created environment setup and model installation utilities

The basic structure of the application is in place, allowing users to interact with the agent through a command-line interface. The agent can process user queries, maintain conversation context, and generate code.

## What to do next
Our immediate next steps are:
1. Implement the long-term memory module using ChromaDB for persistent knowledge storage
   - Create vector embeddings for code snippets and knowledge
   - Implement similarity search for retrieving relevant information
   - Add automatic knowledge capture from interactions
2. Create a memory manager to coordinate between short-term and long-term memory systems
   - Develop a unified interface for memory access
   - Implement prioritization algorithms for context management
   - Add memory refresh mechanisms for important information
3. Implement the specialized review agent for code analysis and improvement
   - Create specialized review capabilities beyond the coding agent
   - Add security vulnerability detection
   - Implement performance optimization suggestions
4. Develop core tools for file operations and code execution
   - Add file system interaction tools
   - Create secure code execution sandboxes
   - Implement web search capabilities for documentation
5. Test the system with real-world coding tasks to validate functionality
   - Create a comprehensive test suite
   - Implement evaluation metrics
   - Add automated regression testing

These next steps will significantly enhance the capabilities of our autonomous coding agent, enabling it to maintain knowledge over time, perform specialized code reviews, and interact with external systems.

## What we are trying to solve
We're addressing several challenges in this project:

1. **Local Inference**: Running a powerful LLM locally to maintain privacy and eliminate API costs
   - Using Ollama to run the Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored model
   - Creating an efficient interface for model communication
   - Implementing optimizations for resource usage
2. **Memory Management**: Creating effective short and long-term memory systems for context retention
   - Building conversation history with automatic token management
   - Implementing vector databases for long-term knowledge storage
   - Creating memory coordination for optimal context usage
3. **Self-Improvement**: Developing mechanisms for the agent to learn from experience and improve
   - Implementing reflection capabilities
   - Creating knowledge augmentation systems
   - Adding learning from corrections and feedback
4. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Enabling multiple agent instances to work together and enhance each other
   - Building a specialized agent architecture
   - Creating agent communication protocols
   - Implementing collaborative problem-solving mechanisms
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Optimizing performance to run effectively on consumer hardware
   - Using model quantization techniques
   - Implementing caching mechanisms
   - Creating batch processing capabilities

The ultimate goal is to create an autonomous coding assistant that can effectively handle complex programming tasks while continuously improving its capabilities through experience and collaboration with other agent instances.
