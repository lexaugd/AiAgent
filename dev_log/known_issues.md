## Learning System Limitations

The learning system, while functional, has some limitations:

- **Heuristic-Based Extraction**: Knowledge extraction relies on pattern matching and heuristics, which may miss complex patterns or extract low-quality information
- **Confidence Scoring**: The current confidence scoring system is relatively simple and may not always accurately reflect knowledge quality
- **Reflection Depth**: Self-reflection quality is highly dependent on having a sufficient quantity and diversity of experiences
- **Feedback Analysis**: Current trend analysis for feedback is basic and may miss subtle patterns
- **Learning Integration**: While the learning components are implemented, their integration with decision-making could be deeper
- **Limited Transfer Learning**: There's no mechanism yet for applying knowledge across domains
- **Passive Learning**: The system currently learns passively from interactions rather than actively seeking information

## Autonomous Operation Challenges

Implementing autonomous operation capabilities presents several unique challenges:

### Safety and Control

- **Risk of Unintended Actions**: Autonomous agents could perform actions with unintended consequences if not properly constrained
- **Monitoring Mechanisms**: Need robust monitoring to track agent actions and halt execution if necessary
- **Permission System**: Requires a comprehensive permission system for different types of actions

### Decision Making

- **Task Decomposition Complexity**: Breaking down complex goals into appropriate subtasks is challenging
- **Planning Limitations**: Current LLMs may struggle with complex, multi-step planning
- **Recursive Planning**: Loops or excessive recursion in planning could cause performance issues
- **Handling Uncertainty**: Agent must make decisions with incomplete information

### Tool Usage

- **Tool Selection**: Choosing the most appropriate tool for a given task is non-trivial
- **Error Recovery**: Need robust mechanisms for handling tool execution failures
- **Resource Management**: Must prevent excessive resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
- **Security Boundaries**: Tools need proper sandboxing and security constraints

### Continuous Operation

- **Context Management**: Maintaining relevant context over time without exceeding token limits
- **Loop Termination**: Determining when to stop autonomous operation
- **Idle Time Handling**: Managing behavior during periods of low activity
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitoring and reporting long-running tasks

### Integration Challenges

- **CLI Mode Extension**: Current CLI interface needs extension for autonomous mode
- **Interruption Handling**: Need mechanisms to safely interrupt and resume autonomous operation
- **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporating user feedback during autonomous operation
- **Autonomous/Interactive Mode Switching**: Seamlessly transitioning between modes

## Limitations

- The Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored model requires significant system resources (RAM, CPU/GPU)
  - Minimum 8GB RAM required, 16GB recommended
  - GPU acceleration highly recommended for reasonable performance
- Local inference will be slower than cloud-based alternatives
  - First-time responses may take 10-30 seconds depending on hardware
  - Subsequent responses with context can take longer
- The uncensored model may produce outputs that require careful handling
  - No content filtering implemented yet
  - May generate insecure or problematic code without warnings
- Limited execution capabilities
  - Code execution implemented with basic safety measures
  - Limited language support (currently Python and JavaScript)
  - Basic resource constraints via timeouts
  - No web search capabilities
- Agent specialization is currently basic
  - Routing logic is simplistic
  - No true multi-agent collaboration yet
- Response quality varies with the model
  - Responses can sometimes be incomplete or contain artifacts
  - Chinese characters sometimes appear in English responses
- Permission system needs further refinement
  - Currently supports basic read/write/execute permissions
  - More granular permissions and role-based access needed
- Autonomous operation is limited to one session
  - State persistence exists but not across multiple machines
  - No distributed agent capabilities
