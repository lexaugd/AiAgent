# Model Change: Wizard-Vicuna-13B to DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B

## Summary
We have replaced the Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored model with the DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Instruct model in our autonomous agent system. This change was made to improve code generation capabilities and reduce hallucinations that were previously observed.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made
1. **Removed Wizard-Vicuna-13B model**
   - The previous model was uninstalled from Ollama

2. **Installed DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Instruct** 
   - Installed the newer model using Ollama
   - This model is specifically designed for code generation tasks

3. **Updated Configuration**
   - Modified `config.py` to use the new model
   - Set temperature to 0.35 (optimal for code generation based on research)
   - Kept other parameters consistent

4. **Created Test Scripts**
   - Implemented a comprehensive test script to verify model functionality
   - Tested basic code generation, code reasoning, and complex problem-solving

### Benchmark Results
Initial testing shows significant improvements in:
- **Code Quality**: More accurate and robust code generation
- **Bug Detection**: Better at identifying logical errors in code
- **Reasoning**: Improved ability to explain code functionality and issues
- **Hallucination Reduction**: Less likely to invent fictional libraries or concepts

## Rationale
The DeepSeek-Coder model was chosen based on:
1. Strong performance on coding benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, etc.)
2. Lower hallucination rate compared to Wizard-Vicuna
3. Good balance between model size and performance
4. Specific optimization for code-related tasks
5. Availability in Ollama

## Next Steps
1. **Monitor Performance**: Track the model's performance in real-world usage
2. **Gather Feedback**: Collect feedback on code quality and hallucination rates
3. **Fine-tune Parameters**: Adjust temperature and other parameters based on observed performance
4. **Consider Future Models**: Keep evaluating new models like Qwen2.5-Coder-7B when they become available in Ollama
