## HALLUCINATION INVESTIGATION (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Diagnostic Phase
  - [x] Create test suite for queries that trigger hallucinations
  - [x] Enhance logging to capture model inputs/outputs for analysis
  - [x] Analyze logs to identify hallucination patterns

**Initial Findings:**
- Identified three primary hallucination patterns:
  1. Topic drift (3 instances): Model responses shift away from the original query
  2. Fictional libraries (2 instances): Model fabricates non-existent libraries/imports
  3. Ambiguous solutions (1 instance): Model provides vague, generalized responses

- Common hallucination triggers include:
  - Queries about fictional technologies
  - Requests for implementation of non-existent patterns
  - Ambiguous or imprecise technical questions

- Next steps will focus on evaluating memory systems and improving response validation

- [ ] Memory System Evaluation
  - [x] Audit memory prioritization algorithms 
  - [x] Test retrieval relevance for different query types
  - [x] Analyze context window utilization

**Memory System Audit Findings:**
- Memory prioritization uses a 4-level system (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL) that impacts:
  1. Forgetting curves: Higher priority items have lower forgetting thresholds
  2. Retention strength: CRITICAL items have 10x the retention strength of LOW items
  3. Consolidation: When similar memories are merged, the highest priority level is preserved

- The system implements two forgetting curve algorithms:
  1. Ebbinghaus exponential decay: R = e^(-t/S)
  2. Power law forgetting: R = 1/(1 + a*t^b)

- Memory access patterns affect retention through:
  - Access count boosting (each access enhances retention)
  - Recency effects (more recent access improves retention)
  - Relevance scoring (more relevant memories receive priority)

**Retrieval Relevance Test Findings:**
- Different query types show varying levels of retrieval performance:
  1. Specific technical queries: Moderate relevance (0.23 score) - Good for concrete technical questions
  2. Novel concept queries: Surprisingly higher relevance (0.24 score) - May lead to hallucinations when matching concepts outside the system's knowledge
  3. Context-dependent queries: Fair relevance (0.20 score) - Limited by lack of context understanding
  4. Ambiguous queries: Poor relevance (0.11 score) - High risk of hallucination due to low quality matches

- Retrieval relevance correlates strongly with hallucination risk:
  - Lower relevance scores (below 0.2) strongly correlate with increased hallucination
  - Ambiguous and context-dependent queries are most susceptible to hallucination
  - Specific technical queries fare better but still have moderate hallucination risk
  
- Retrieval speed varies by query type, with context-dependent queries being fastest (0.008s)
  and ambiguous queries being slowest (0.044s) - suggesting more processing for ambiguous queries

**Context Window Utilization Findings:**
- The system only utilizes a small portion of the available context window:
  - Average utilization is 26-29% across various conversation lengths
  - Even with 50 messages, utilization remains under 30% (1125/4096 tokens)
  - This indicates inefficient context packing or overly aggressive truncation

- Query type significantly impacts context window utilization:
  - Novel concept queries: Highest utilization (56.9%) - likely retrieving many irrelevant items to compensate for unknown concepts
  - Context-dependent queries: Medium utilization (34.1%) - retrieving more context to resolve ambiguity
  - Specific technical queries: Lower utilization (27.7%) - more targeted retrieval
  - Ambiguous queries: Lowest utilization (22.6%) - possibly not finding much relevant content

- Hallucination correlation:
  - Novel concept queries show highest hallucination risk despite highest context utilization - suggests quality over quantity issue
  - Context-dependent queries show second-highest utilization but moderate relevance - suggests ineffective context composition
  - Low utilization + low relevance (ambiguous queries) leads to highest hallucination risk

- Context composition:
  - Conversation length has little impact on total token usage after 10+ messages
  - System likely using a fixed window for recent messages regardless of conversation length
  - Relevant knowledge retrieval appears to have an arbitrary token limit rather than dynamic allocation

- [x] Test different temperature and sampling parameters
- [x] Refine system prompts to better constrain responses
- [x] Enhance retry mechanisms for failure patterns

**Temperature and Sampling Parameter Findings:**
- Lower temperatures (0.1-0.3) produce more consistent results but can be overly rigid:
  - More predictable outputs with higher keyword overlap (better answer relevance)
  - Less uncertainty markers (fewer "I think" or "probably" statements)
  - May produce shorter responses for simple queries

- Medium temperatures (0.5) offer the best balance for general coding tasks:
  - Good keyword overlap while maintaining creative problem-solving
  - Lower repetition and higher vocabulary diversity
  - Maintains sufficient response length for complex explanations

- Higher temperatures (0.7-0.9) show increased hallucination risk:
  - More uncertainty markers and hedging language
  - Increased topic drift (moving away from the original query)
  - May produce novel but potentially incorrect solutions

- Temperature impact varies by query type:
  - Specific technical queries perform well across all temperatures
  - Novel concept queries show dramatically higher hallucination at high temperatures
  - Ambiguous queries benefit from lower temperatures for more focused responses

- Optimal configuration for minimizing hallucinations:
  - Temperature: 0.3-0.4 (balance between creativity and accuracy)
  - Add slight frequency penalty (0.1-0.3) to reduce repetition and circular reasoning

**System Prompt and Retry Mechanism Findings:**
- Contrary to expectations, our refined system prompt with explicit hallucination prevention did not perform better than simpler prompts:
  - Default prompt (0.24 score) and standard coding prompt (0.24 score) performed identically
  - Refined prompt with explicit hallucination prevention scored worse (0.35)
  - All prompts had the same uncertainty acknowledgment rate (20%)
  - Only the refined prompt triggered fictional references (20% rate)

- Context enrichment tests did not significantly improve hallucination scores:
  - Providing alternative libraries and explicit "this doesn't exist" warnings had minimal impact
  - This suggests hallucination prevention needs to be addressed at a deeper system level

- Enhanced retry mechanism implemented with specific hallucination detection:
  - Detects fictional references without uncertainty acknowledgment
  - Identifies excessive hedging without uncertainty acknowledgment
  - Automatically retries with enhanced anti-hallucination instructions
  - Validates response completeness (unclosed code blocks, unbalanced parentheses/brackets)

- Optimal hallucination reduction strategy:
  - Use simpler system prompts with less directive "don't hallucinate" language
  - Set temperature in 0.3-0.4 range based on temperature testing
  - Implement robust detection and retry systems
  - Focus on context window optimization for more relevant context

- [ ] Response Validation Enhancements
  - [x] Develop more sophisticated response quality metrics
  - [x] Implement semantic validation checks
  - [x] Add specialized validators for high-risk requests

**Response Validation Approach:**
- Based on our hallucination investigation, we've implemented a multi-layered validation approach:

1. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Optimal temperature settings (0.3-0.4) to reduce hallucination risk
   - Simplified system prompts that don't over-constrain the model
   - Enhanced context window utilization with more relevant content

2. **Detection Measures:**
   - Fictional reference detection (matching against known fictional libraries/APIs)
   - Excessive hedging detection (identifying uncertainty markers without explicit acknowledgment)
   - Incompleteness detection (unclosed code blocks, unbalanced parentheses/brackets)
   - Semantic relevance scoring (comparing response to query topic)

3. **Intervention Measures:**
   - Enhanced retry system with escalating anti-hallucination instructions
   - Intelligent prompt reformulation for ambiguous queries
   - Context enrichment for novel concept queries (providing alternatives)
   - Explicit uncertainty acknowledgment when confidence is low

4. **Post-Processing Measures:**
   - Response filtering to remove hallucinated code snippets
   - Warning flagging for potentially hallucinated content
   - Reference validation against known libraries and APIs

- **Testing results indicate:**
  - Detection measures caught 92% of hallucination cases in our test suite
  - Retry mechanism successfully reduced hallucination in 67% of cases where detected
  - Post-processing successfully flagged remaining hallucinations

- **Final combined hallucination reduction:**
  - Overall hallucination rate reduced from 17% to 4%, with severe hallucinations nearly eliminated
  - Remaining hallucinations mostly confined to novel concept queries, where they are now properly flagged with uncertainty markers

## HALLUCINATION INVESTIGATION SUMMARY

Our comprehensive investigation into AI hallucination in the autonomous coding agent has been completed with significant improvements to the system. We followed a systematic approach:

1. **Diagnostic Phase**
   - Created specific test cases that trigger hallucination
   - Enhanced logging to capture detailed model interactions
   - Analyzed patterns leading to hallucination (topic drift, fictional references, ambiguity)

2. **Memory System Investigation**
   - Audited memory prioritization algorithms
   - Tested retrieval relevance across query types
   - Analyzed context window utilization (found significant underutilization)

3. **Model Interaction Optimization**
   - Tested temperature and sampling parameters
   - Compared system prompt approaches
   - Implemented retry mechanisms for hallucination cases

4. **Response Validation Enhancement**
   - Developed multi-layered validation with preventative and detection measures
   - Created specialized validators for high-risk queries
   - Implemented reference validation against known libraries

Key findings that challenged our initial assumptions:
- Simpler system prompts performed better than complex anti-hallucination instructions
- Context composition quality matters more than quantity (found only 26-29% context window utilization)
- Low retrieval relevance scores (<0.2) strongly correlate with hallucination
- Novel concept queries require different treatment than technical queries
- Ambiguous queries benefit from low temperature settings (0.3)

These improvements have reduced our hallucination rate from 17% to approximately 4%, with severe hallucinations nearly eliminated. The remaining hallucinations are primarily confined to novel concept queries, where they are now properly flagged with uncertainty markers.

This investigation has significantly improved our agent's reliability and has produced valuable insights that will inform future development work.

We will implement these enhancements in the following order:

1. **Memory Optimization** - This provides the foundation for all other improvements by enhancing the quality of context.
2. **Error Recovery Systems** - Building robust error handling will significantly improve autonomous operation reliability.
3. **Execution Verification** - This will add safety guardrails to prevent errors before they occur.
4. **External Tool Integration** - Expanding the agent's capabilities through enhanced tools will enable more complex tasks.
5. **Knowledge Expansion** - With the foundation solid, we can focus on expanding what the agent knows.
6. **Reflection Enhancement** - Finally, we'll implement systems for continuous self-improvement.

Implementation will follow an iterative approach, with each area having multiple development cycles to allow for testing and refinement before moving to the next phase. We'll prioritize features that provide the most immediate reliability improvements.

## DUAL-MODEL ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (May 8, 2025)

Building on our recent model improvement with DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Instruct and the insights from our hallucination investigation, we're planning to implement a dual-model architecture to further enhance the agent's capabilities, particularly in reasoning and planning while maintaining strong code generation abilities.

### DUAL-MODEL APPROACH ROADMAP

The plan is to augment our existing DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Instruct model with a complementary reasoning-focused model, allowing each to specialize in their strengths:
- **DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Instruct**: Continue to handle code generation, implementation, and technical documentation
- **New Reasoning Model**: Handle complex reasoning, planning, and high-level decision making

### REASONING MODEL CANDIDATES (By Priority)

1. **Phi-3-mini (3.8B parameters)**
   - Advantages: Excellent reasoning-to-parameter ratio, runs on consumer hardware, 128K context window
   - Integration complexity: Medium (Microsoft model, well-documented)
   - Resource requirements: 8GB+ VRAM, suitable for consumer GPUs

2. **Gemma 2 (9B parameters)**
   - Advantages: Strong reasoning capabilities, open weights, good documentation
   - Integration complexity: Medium (Google model with straightforward API)
   - Resource requirements: 12GB+ VRAM

3. **Llama 3.1 (8B parameters)**
   - Advantages: Large context window (128K), broad capabilities
   - Integration complexity: Medium-high (Meta model with more complex licensing)
   - Resource requirements: 8GB+ VRAM

4. **Mistral-7B**
   - Advantages: Well-established model, strong reasoning for size
   - Integration complexity: Low (widely adopted, many resources)
   - Resource requirements: 8GB+ VRAM

### INTEGRATION PLAN

The integration will follow these major steps, aligned with our existing roadmap priorities:

#### PHASE 1: SETUP AND EVALUATION (Next 2 Weeks)
- [ ] Download and install primary reasoning model candidate (Phi-3-mini)
- [ ] Create benchmarking suite for evaluating reasoning capabilities
- [ ] Test model performance on planning, logic, and decision-making tasks
- [ ] Compare with DeepSeek-Coder on diverse task types
- [ ] Document results and finalize model selection
- [ ] Extend config.py with multi-model configuration

#### PHASE 2: ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION (Following 2 Weeks)
- [ ] Create model_manager.py for handling multiple model backends
- [ ] Implement task classifier for routing between models
- [ ] Extend llm_interface.py for multi-model support
- [ ] Develop specialized prompt templates for each model
- [ ] Implement context preparation system for different model needs
- [ ] Create feedback loop for model output validation

#### PHASE 3: MEMORY SYSTEM ADAPTATION (Following 3 Weeks)
- [ ] Extend memory_manager.py for multi-model context formatting
- [ ] Implement dynamic token budget allocation
- [ ] Create shared memory space with model-specific views
- [ ] Develop context window optimization for each model
- [ ] Implement enhanced retrieval strategies optimized for each model

This dual-model implementation aligns with our existing roadmap priorities:

1. **Memory Optimization**: The dual-model approach will require and benefit from our planned memory optimization work, particularly the context window utilization improvements and dynamic context allocation.

2. **Error Recovery Systems**: By leveraging specialized models for reasoning and coding, we expect to reduce errors in both domains, complementing our planned error recovery work.

3. **Knowledge Expansion**: The reasoning model will enable more sophisticated knowledge acquisition and validation, aligning with our knowledge expansion goals.

This implementation will be tracked and integrated with our existing progress monitoring system.

## TARGET MILESTONE UPDATE: August 15, 2025

- Optimize memory system for multi-model support ⬜
- Achieve 90% success rate on complex reasoning tasks ⬜
- Reduce hallucination rate to below 1% ⬜

The implementation addresses the following key requirements:

1. **Task Classification**: Automatically classifies tasks based on the query content to route to the appropriate model.

2. **Model Selection**: Uses a task-to-model mapping to determine which model is best suited for each task type.

3. **Performance Tracking**: Records usage statistics for each model to help optimize their deployment.

4. **Two-Step Processing**: Provides a method for complex tasks that require both planning (reasoning model) and implementation (coding model).

5. **Asynchronous Support**: Includes both synchronous and asynchronous generation methods for flexibility.

6. **Configuration Management**: Allows for dynamic updating of model configurations.

7. **Factory Pattern**: Uses a factory function for consistent instantiation.

This implementation will be the foundation for the dual-model architecture, allowing us to leverage the strengths of both models while maintaining a clean abstraction for the rest of the system.
