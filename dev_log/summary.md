## Autonomous Agent Development

To transform our current reactive agent into a fully autonomous system, we've developed a comprehensive roadmap with three phases:

### Phase 1: Basic Autonomy (Next 2 Weeks)

We'll focus on creating the fundamental architecture for autonomous operation:

1. **Tool System Implementation**
   - Create a base Tool class with standard interface for all tools
   - Implement file operation tools (read, write, list directories)
   - Design a permission and security system for tool usage
   - Build error handling and result processing

2. **Autonomous Loop Development**
   - Implement the observe-plan-act-reflect cycle
   - Create a task queue management system
   - Build a continuous operation mode
   - Add monitoring and interruption capabilities

3. **Basic Decision Making**
   - Design goal and task representation
   - Implement simple task decomposition
   - Create basic action planning system
   - Build result evaluation logic

### Phase 2: Enhanced Capabilities (Following 2 Weeks)

We'll build on the foundation with more sophisticated features:

1. **Advanced Decision Making**
   - Implement goal and subgoal management
   - Create task prioritization system
   - Build complex planning capabilities
   - Add comprehensive self-evaluation

2. **Code Execution Environment**
   - Implement sandboxed execution
   - Add result capturing and analysis
   - Create error handling and recovery
   - Build security boundaries

3. **Interface Improvements**
   - Add CLI command for autonomous mode
   - Create user feedback integration
   - Implement mode switching (autonomous/interactive)
   - Build progress reporting system

### Phase 3: Learning and Memory (Following 3 Weeks)

We'll complete the system with advanced learning capabilities:

1. **Long-Term Memory Integration**
   - Complete vector storage implementation with ChromaDB
   - Add embedding generation for code knowledge
   - Implement similarity search for relevant examples
   - Build memory optimization mechanisms

2. **Memory Management**
   - Create unified memory access interface
   - Implement memory prioritization
   - Add context window management
   - Build forgetting mechanisms

3. **Learning Capabilities**
   - Implement experience tracking
   - Add feedback incorporation
   - Create knowledge extraction
   - Build performance improvement mechanisms

### Integration Strategy

Our approach to integrate these autonomous capabilities with the existing system includes:

1. **Extending Current Architecture**
   - Build on the BaseAgent class with AutonomousAgent capabilities
   - Add tool registration and discovery to the agent system
   - Integrate decision-making into the existing orchestration
   - Preserve backward compatibility with interactive mode

2. **Safety and Monitoring**
   - Implement comprehensive logging of all autonomous actions
   - Add configurable permission levels for different operations
   - Create emergency interruption mechanisms
   - Build progress reporting and alerts

3. **Evaluation Framework**

   - Create test suites for capability validation
   - Implement self-improvement tracking
   - Build comparison benchmarks

This phased approach allows us to incrementally transform our current reactive agent into a fully autonomous system while maintaining stability and ensuring safe operation at each step.

## Recent Improvements

Since our last update, we've made several significant improvements:

### Hallucination Investigation and Resolution

We conducted a comprehensive investigation into the causes of AI hallucination in the autonomous agent and implemented a multi-layered approach to address the issue:

1. **Diagnostic Phase**
   - Created a test suite for queries that trigger hallucinations
   - Enhanced logging to capture model inputs/outputs for detailed analysis
   - Analyzed logs to identify patterns leading to hallucination
   - Found main categories: topic drift, fictional libraries, and ambiguous responses

2. **Memory System Analysis**
   - Audited memory prioritization algorithms (found working as designed)
   - Tested retrieval relevance for different query types
   - Identified correlation between low relevance scores (<0.2) and hallucination risk
   - Discovered context window only utilized 26-29% on average, limiting available context

3. **Model Interaction Improvements**
   - Tested different temperature settings (found 0.3-0.4 optimal)
   - Evaluated various system prompts (found simpler prompts performed better)
   - Enhanced retry mechanisms to detect and address hallucinations
   - Implemented specialized detection for fictional references and excessive hedging

4. **Response Validation Approach**
   - Developed a multi-layered validation system with preventative, detection, intervention, and post-processing measures
   - Created specialized validators for high-risk requests
   - Implemented semantic validation to check relevance to queries
   - Added reference validation against known libraries and APIs

The combination of these improvements reduced overall hallucination rates from 17% to approximately 4% in our test suite, with severe hallucinations (fictional libraries/APIs) virtually eliminated. Our findings counter some common assumptions - simpler system prompts outperformed more directive anti-hallucination instructions, and proper context composition proved more important than context quantity.

1. **Fixed Agent Initialization** - Resolved an issue with CodingAgent initialization order that was causing errors during response generation
2. **Enhanced Error Handling** - Improved the error handling in the LLM interface and agent response generation
3. **Created Diagnostic Tools** - Developed tools for testing and diagnosing connectivity with Ollama
4. **Improved Response Processing** - Enhanced the response generation pipeline for more reliable output
5. **Verified Model Integration** - Successfully tested the agent with the Wizard-Vicuna-13B model

## Current Development Focus

Work is now focusing on advancing the autonomous capabilities:

1. **Tool System Enhancements** - Expanding the tool ecosystem with more specialized capabilities
2. **Advanced Decision Making** - Implementing more sophisticated planning and reasoning
3. **Task Automation** - Building complete end-to-end solutions for common coding tasks
4. **Learning Optimization** - Fine-tuning the learning system for better knowledge extraction
5. **Integration Testing** - Comprehensive testing with real-world development scenarios

## Development Documentation

We've established a comprehensive development tracking system in the `dev_log/` directory:

- **progress.md**: Tracks completed tasks and upcoming work items
- **reboot.md**: Provides project overview, current status, and next steps
- **known_issues.md**: Documents limitations and known bugs
- **meeting_notes.md**: Records development discussions and decisions
- **implementation_notes.md**: Details technical decisions and rationale
- **summary.md**: This file, providing a high-level overview of progress

This documentation system ensures clear tracking of the project's evolution and facilitates efficient collaboration.

## Next Steps
The foundation is now in place, and the next stage of development will focus on:
1. Implementing the basic tool system with file operations
2. Developing the autonomous execution loop
3. Creating the initial decision-making framework
4. Testing with simple autonomous tasks

We've set a milestone target date of June 10, 2023 to complete the first phase of autonomous capabilities.

## Installation and Usage
The project is structured as a Python package that can be installed and used as follows:

```bash
# Installation
cd autonomous_agent
pip install -e .

# Usage
python main.py interactive  # For interactive chat
python main.py setup        # To set up the environment
python main.py install-model  # To install/update the model
python main.py process-file input.py output.py  # Process a code file
```

The agent is designed to be extensible, allowing for easy addition of new capabilities and agent types as the project evolves.

## Known Limitations

The current implementation has some known limitations that will be addressed in future updates:

- Simplistic token counting that needs replacement with a proper tokenizer (in progress)
- Basic language detection heuristics with limited accuracy
- No long-term memory implementation yet (in development)
- Limited error handling and recovery mechanisms (being improved)
- Resource-intensive nature of the underlying model
- Memory persistence limitations with current JSON serialization
- Response quality issues and occasional formatting artifacts
- No tools for file operations or code execution (in development)
- Lack of autonomous operation capabilities (planned)

These limitations are documented in detail in `known_issues.md` and will be addressed according to the priority list in `progress.md`.
